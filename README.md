## About Me

Iâ€™m a second year Computer Science (Data Science) student at Christ University, passionate about coding and always eager to learn new things. Right now, Iâ€™m focusing on building my skills in Python, C, and Java as part of my curriculum. I believe in exploring different languages to discover my strengths and areas for growth.

Outside academics, youâ€™ll probably find me with a good book or on the football field!
